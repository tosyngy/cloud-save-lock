# cloud-save-lock

The project work is a website application that runs on any platform as the tools used in its development are used for designing cross-platform application for both the frond and the back-end respectively.

The approach is to design an application where people can create their own personal space (private data storage) to store information which they will make use of in the future and to avoid unauthorized people from sniffing or hacking into their own personal computer, hence they back-up or work on the cloud where their data is secured from both the host (by encryption) and unauthorized party; they can access their work from anywhere around the globe so long they know their login parameters and have privilege to update, store more as well as delete as preferred by the user so long they have not exceeded their allotted storage space (megabyte) they subscribed for.
